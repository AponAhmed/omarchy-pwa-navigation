# Omarchy PWA Nav Buttons Extension

A lightweight Chrome/Chromium extension built specifically for **Omarchy OS Web Apps (PWAs)**.  
In Omarchy PWAs, the built-in navigation (Back, Forward, Reload) is often unavailable.  
This extension adds a floating toolbar with **Back**, **Reload**, and **Forward** buttons so you can easily navigate inside any installed PWA.
